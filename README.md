## 🌟 Who Am I?

> *Building the decentralized future, one block at a time* 🔗

Hey! I'm that guy who gets genuinely excited talking about merkle trees over coffee ☕ and believes that blockchain isn't just technology—it's the foundation of a more open internet 🌐

**🚀 4+ years deep** in the blockchain rabbit hole, and honestly? I'm still discovering new layers every day. From writing my first "Hello World" smart contract to architecting DeFi protocols that handle real money and real users—it's been one hell of a ride! 

## 🎯 What Gets Me Up in the Morning

- 🔥 **Building stuff that matters**: DeFi protocols, cross-chain bridges, and dApps that people actually use
- 🧠 **Teaching & Mentoring**: Helped 100+ developers level up their Web3 game (trust me, explaining Substrate to beginners is an art form!)
- 🏆 **Hackathon Warrior**: 8+ wins and counting—because who doesn't love building the impossible in 48 hours?
- 🔬 **Research & Experimentation**: Always tinkering with the latest protocols and pushing boundaries
